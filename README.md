## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for agents to communicate and operate within a shared context. This repository provides a straightforward implementation of an MCP server that interacts with multiple agent frameworks. It showcases how different agents can work together to solve complex problems using a common protocol.

## Features

- **Multiple Agent Frameworks**: Supports various frameworks for flexibility.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process to get you started quickly.
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Includes examples to demonstrate functionality.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for modification and enhancement.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several technologies and frameworks:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **ADK-Python**: For developing agent-based applications.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management.
- **OpenAI**: For integrating AI capabilities.
- **Gemini**: For advanced agent functionalities.
- **Logfire**: For logging and monitoring.
- **MCP Server**: The core of the project, implementing the Model Context Protocol.
